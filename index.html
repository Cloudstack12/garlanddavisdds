                    <b style="color: #266f7c; font-size: large;">Have you ever asked yourself the question: how beneficial are dental cleanings? Read on to learn about the many advantages of getting it done.</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Nearly 50% of insured Americans have skipped dental visits. Counting those without dental insurance, the percentage increases to 65%. <br>
                    <br>
                    Without routine dental cleanings, you could put your oral hygiene at risk. You might not recognize there's a serious issue with your oral health until the problem has progressed. <br>
                    <br>
                    Here are a few benefits of visiting your dentist in Laurel, MD every six months. After reading this dentist guide, you can determine if it's time for your next cleaning. Read on to learn more.

                    <b style="color: #266f7c; font-size: large;">Improved Oral Hygiene</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the top reasons to visit a dentist twice a year is to improve and maintain your oral health. Otherwise, you might not spot issues with your oral health until a problem progresses. <br>
                    <br>
                    Improving your oral health can also benefit your overall health. Otherwise, bacteria can spread throughout your body, leading to health problems and complications. <br>
                    <br>
                    Here are a few ways the best dentist in Laurel can improve your oral hygiene. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Cavity Prevention</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    If you fail to brush and floss your teeth twice a day, food particles will linger in your mouth. These particles can mix with bacteria, allowing plaque to form. Plaque can release acids to erode the protective enamel around your teeth. <br>
                    <br>
                    Cavities could form as a result. <br>
                    <br>
                    Routine dental cleanings can help prevent cavity formation. <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, your dentist can spot the signs of plaque development. They can provide you with helpful tips to minimize plaque formation before plaque can destroy your teeth. <br>
                    <br>
                    hey might offer ways you can improve your oral hygiene routine, too. For example, they might recommend you switch to fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash. They might suggest you begin using an electric toothbrush, too. <br>
                    <br>
                    Choose a dentist who prioritizes prevention to improve your oral health long-term. <br> 
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Keep Breath Fresh</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    If you're not thoroughly brushing and flossing your teeth, bacteria will spread within your mouth. Bacteria can contribute to bad breath. <br>
                    <br>
                    Let your Laurel, MD dentist know if brushing isn't keeping your breath fresh. There's a chance you have a serious oral health issue like gingivitis. Otherwise, ask for tips to keep your breath odor-free year-round. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Avoid Gingivitis and Loose Teeth</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Over <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/conditions/periodontal-disease.html">47% of adults</a>  over the age of 30 have some form of periodontal disease. Unfortunately, the risk increases with age. Over 70% of adults over the age of 65 have periodontal disease. <br>
                    <br>
                    Periodontal disease is a progressed form of gum disease. In its initial state (gingivitis), your gums can become inflamed. They'll look red, swollen, and may bleed when you brush or floss your teeth. <br>
                    <br>
                    Gingivitis develops if you fail to brush and floss, allowing plaque to form. This sticky film can eventually harden into calculus or tartar. Tartar can then build and spread below the gum line, making it difficult to clean away. <br>
                    <br>
                    You'll need to visit your <a href="https://www.garlanddavisdds.com/">Laurel, MD dentist</a>  for a professional cleaning. <br>
                    <br>
                    Otherwise, you might notice symptoms like: <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bad breath that doesn't go away</li>
                        <li>Sensitive teeth</li>
                        <li>Tender or bleeding gums</li>
                        <li>Red or swollen gums</li>
                        <li>Loose teeth</li>
                        <li>Gums that recede from the gum line</li>
                        <li>Changes in how your teeth fit together</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Without treatment, periodontal disease will cause your teeth to loosen. You might lose a tooth without treatment. Before that can happen, visit a dentist for routine cleanings. <br>
                    <br>
                    Dental cleanings will allow your dentist to spot signs of gingivitis while it's still in the initial stages. They can ensure you begin treatment right away. <br>

                <h2 style="color: #266f7c;">Early Detection</h2>
                <p>
                    Visiting a dentist twice a year for cleanings can also give your dentist the chance to detect any oral health issues. <br>
                    <br>  
                    Let your dentist know about any symptoms you're experiencing, like bad breath or toothaches. They can complete a visual inspection or schedule a dental x-ray. Then, they can detect issues like tooth decay or gum disease to keep the problem from progressing. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you're neglecting routine appointments, you might leave a problem untreated for too long. You could require more extensive treatment as a result. <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 style="color: #266f7c;">Save Time and Money</h2>
                <p>
                    If an oral health problem remains untreated, you'll need more extensive treatment. For example, you might require a tooth canal, dental implant to remove a tooth, or oral surgery. To treat gingivitis, you might need root scaling and planing. <br>
                    <br>
                    These procedures could become expensive, especially if you develop more than one issue. <br>
                    <br>
                    Routine cleanings can help you save time, money, and stress. Your dentist can help you prevent these problems from developing in the first place. Investing in your oral health now could help you avoid expensive problems in the future. <br>

                    <br>
                    If you have gingivitis, you could begin grinding your teeth, causing insomnia and worn enamel. <br>
                    <br>
                    One problem can lead to the next. Before that can happen, visit a dentist. <br>
